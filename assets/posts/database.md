<h5>A database system built from the ground up and programmed in C. Showcases understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and database design principles.</h5>

<img src="/assets/images/db_demo.gif">

<p>Collaborated on the development of a custom database system implemented entirely in C as part of a group project. My primary responsibilities included implementing core SQL operations such as INSERT, DELETE, and SELECT, along with support for more complex subqueries using WHERE and FROM clauses.</p>

<p>I was responsible for designing and implementing the page splitting mechanism and page buffer system, which temporarily stores data in memory before writing it to disk. I also handled low-level I/O operations, including reading from and writing to hardware in binary format, ensuring user data persistence and security.</p>

<p>Additionally, I contributed to the design and implementation of a B+ tree insertion algorithm to optimize query performance. I ensured proper memory management through extensive debugging with GDB and played a key role in building both the Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) parsers.</p>
