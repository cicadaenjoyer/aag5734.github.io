<h5>FlashcardFables is a Java project that aims to make studying fun by combining the concept of flashcards with an adventurous game</h5>

In this game, players are given spell cards with terms on them, and they will encounter enemies marked with definitions. To defeat the enemies and progress in the game, players must choose the correct spell card (the term linked with the enemy's definition). To master each card, players must successfully defeat enemies using the same card five times.

This game makes use of Java.
