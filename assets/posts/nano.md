<h5>A Discord bot that uses ChatGPT to provide responsive solutions and engage in discourse with Discord community members. Additionally, Nano facilitates the capability to assign member role assignments among other functionalities.</h5>

<p>This project started out as a fun little joke among friends, but I have since expanded its scope to enhance its functionality.</p>

<p>NanoBot is constructed using Javascript and its corresponding DiscordJS libraries. More information can be found on the public release of NanoBot.</p>
