<h5>A small application that takes an exisiting VNDB account and returns a list of recommended visual novels based on the user's most enjoyed categories.</h5>

<p>VNDB (short for the visual novel database) is a website where people can search for Japanese visual novels and rate them from a scale of 1-10. Users can also add them to their list of wanted visual novels and more. Since the site doesn't have its own recommender system, I decided to take initiative.</p>
