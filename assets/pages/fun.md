<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">What's Abe Up To?</h3>
<p style="text-align:center">A lot has been going on lately, and it's been both exciting and rewarding! I recently wrapped up a month-long 
mentorship with Bloomberg, where I gained valuable insights on networking, tackled coding challenges, and learned from experienced professionals. 
On the open source side, I made my first contribution to <a href="https://github.com/colorstackorg/oyster" target="_blank">Oyster</a>, ColorStack’s 
student hub—which was a great milestone for me. Academically, I’ve been collaborating with a team on building a database system in C. My focus has 
been on implementing core SQL operations like SELECT, DELETE, and INSERT, along with key components such as the storage catalog and page buffer system. 
I also had the opportunity to contribute to the development of the DDL and DML parser.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">One project I’m particularly excited to begin this month is a real-time emergency response application designed for 
smartwatches. The goal is to detect critical, life-threatening situations and respond accordingly to ensure user safety. This was originally an 
idea I had hoped to submit for the Google Solutions Challenge, but due to time constraints, I wasn’t able to fully commit to it at the time. I’m 
looking forward to diving in now and can’t wait to share updates soon!</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Oh and I guess I've been learning Japanese too haha (level 4 on WaniKani btw).</p>

<h2>Media of the Month</h2>
<h3>April 2025<h3>
<br>
<div class="media-container">
    <div class="media-item">
        <h1>Megaman X4</h1>
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/743890/Mega_Man_X_Legacy_Collection/" target="_blank">
            <img src="/assets/images/game.jpg">
        </a>
        <p>One of the all time greats, the best, the cream of the crop. Megaman X4 is the pinnacle of action packed platformer fun. The controls
        are super fluid, the soundtrack is exilerating, and the boss fights are super exciting! X4 is probably one of my favorite games in the
        genre and I have recently had the pleasure to revisit again. Safe to say, it still holds up in the year 2025!</p>

    <div class="media-item">
        <h1>An Elephant Sitting Still (Soundtrack)</h1>
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0m9977Xhx53ElLWusD0rJb" target="_blank">
            <img src="/assets/images/album.jpeg">
        </a>
        <p>A hauntingly beautiful soundtrack for an equally somber film, this composition masterfully captures the raw emotions of loneliness and 
        despair that permeate the story. Every note resonates with quiet intensity, drawing listeners deeper into the film's melancholic atmosphere. 
        The composer, Hualan, showcases their expertise in the Post-Rock genre, blending ambient textures and emotional depth with a delicate, artful 
        touch.</p>
