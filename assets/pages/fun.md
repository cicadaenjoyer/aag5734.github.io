<p style="text-align:center">School's started and what a nice break it was! I've been meaning to update the site for a while, but I was busy on my first week and felt extremely sick on my second week ╥﹏╥. Regardless though, I'm still here! I'm looking to join a few more clubs and get more involved with the community now that I have some more free time. I have some projects that I look forward to continuing as well, so stay tuned!</p>

        <p>Final Fantasy VII Remake is a game that I have been meaning to get to for the longest time. I've had short spurts
        of interest in the game for a few years, but I have only just now decided to sit down and enjoy the full experience. FFVII is
        a game that is near and dear to my heart. I am a huge fan of the FF series as a whole and it is what jumpstarted my interest in the 
        JRPG genre. While the 'remake' does have it flaws, it's still a masterfully crafted videogame with fun gameplay, stunning visuals,
        and a great soundtrack. It's hard to recommend this game if you have never played the original; as confusing as it sounds, this game is
        NOT a retelling of the original story. I recommend playing through the original or reading a story synposis before diving into the remake!</p>

        <p>Wolfenstein is a first person shooter game where you play as an American WW2 veteran in an alternate world where Germany won the
        war and invaded America. I'm not very keen on FPS games and, admittedly, have only played a handful. What I find interesting about 
        Wolfenstein is its take on how a world where America lost would look like. I enjoy the distopian world that Betheseda created and I
        also believe the gameplay to be fun. However, the game does drag on a bit and some sections do feel monotonous. If you're a fan of FPS
        games, it may be worth it to check this out</p>
