        <p>Pink Floyd is my favorite band by far. I recently got back into listening to them and cannot stop listening to their 
        album 'The Divison Bell'. The songs 'Poles Apart' and 'A Great Day for Freedom' are among my favorite songs of all time;
        they never fail to make me emotional each time I listen to them. The album was made in response to ongoing feuds
        between the band members. It deals with the themes of communication and human relationships. I implore you to listen to
        this album. It is one of the GOATS!</p>

        <h1>Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core Reunion</h1>
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1608070/CRISIS_CORE_FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REUNION/" target="_blank">

        <p>FF7 Crisis Core Reunion is a remake of a PSP game of the same name. It follows Zach, a SHINRA soldier, and his time
        as a rookie doing odd jobs. As the game progresses, he finds himself getting deeper and deeper into an underlying controversy. 
        This is a prequel to Final Fantasy VII and as such is best enjoyed if you've played it first. However, I feel that 
        Crisis Core can still be enjoyed by players who know nothing about the original FF7. Give it a try!</p>
