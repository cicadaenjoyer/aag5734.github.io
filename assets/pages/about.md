_5th Year Computer Science @ Rochester Institute of Technology_.

<h2>About me</h2>
My name is Abraham Hernandez. I am a Spanish-American currently in pursuit of a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science at the Rochester
Institute of Technology. I was raised in San Rafael, California where I started to develop a love for programming. I am currently working part time as a developer for More Vang and I am also part of a few clubs and organizations such as the Google Student Developer Club and ColorStack.

Outside of programming, I am also a huge nerd when it comes down to 90s rock and visual novels (a Japanese subgenre of video games). My top three favorite bands are Pink Floyd, Ween, and DEVO. 

<h2>Experience</h2>

I have worked with many languages and technologies, but of those technologies, the ones that I have had the most recent experience in is **Python, JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, HTML, CSS, and SQL**.

<h2>My goals</h2>

One of my goals is to deliver aid in the form of educating students (both young and older) to prepare them for their future careers. Growing up where I did, there were hardly any programs available to help me in learning more about the field of Computer Science. I want to ensure that students get the help and aid that they deserve so that they can grow to become strong coders in the future. 

Moreover, I want to succeed as a computer scientist so that I can guarantee my mother a long and healthy life as well as pay for my younger sister's college tuition and healthcare treatment.
