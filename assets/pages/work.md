<h2> More Vang <br> Software Programmer </h2>
#### 09/2023 - Present

I was initially tasked with creating automated workflows and programs for PDF templates using PDFKit, JavaScript, Python, and the company's in-house developed rendering engine. Over time, I was gradually given more responsibility, working on projects beyond script development. I engineered core functionalities for the main Laravel site, including webpage redirection and image upload capabilities. Additionally, I implemented accessibility support for the PDF rendering engine, allowing template developers to define logical structures within documents for visually impaired users. Finally, I integrated ChartJS into the companyâ€™s rendering engine, enabling seamless chart generation within PDF templates.

<h2> iD Tech <br> Artificial Inteligence Instructor </h2>
#### 05/2023 - 08/2023

As an instructor, I led groups of 20+ students each week at universities such as Stanford, Berkeley, and San Francisco State. I lectured on topics including deep learning, computer vision, and dense/convolutional neural networks. I also developed lecture materials and coding projects using Python, Java, Matplotlib, and Keras. Additionally, I collaborated with camp counselors to gather feedback and implement improvements, enhancing the overall camp experience and operations.

<h2> RIT <br> Supplemental Instruction Leader | Teacher Assistant </h2>
#### 08/2021 - CURRENT 

As a Supplemental Instructor, I facilitated two 1-hour weekly sessions to help students better understand topics covered in historically challenging computer science courses at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I developed unique coding exercises, lectures, and assignments designed to match the course difficulty level, using programming languages such as Python, Java, and C. This role also involved regular communication with professors to discuss ideal lecturing techniques and analyze course statistics.

As a Teacher Assistant, I graded and evaluated weekly computer science assignments submitted by students in the Computer Science 1 and 2 courses at the Rochester Institute of Technology. These assignments varied in difficulty and programming languages, including a Python program that simulated a railway system using queues and threads, and a C program that replicated basic social media platform functions while managing memory storage. I provided students with timely feedback, offering suggestions for improving memory usage, runtime, code structure, and documentation.

<h2> Catholic Charities <br> Summer Camp Counselor </h2>
#### 09/2016 - 05/2017

I participated in developing and coordinating educational and extracurricular activities for elementary school students in my local community. My responsibilities included assisting students with reading and math skills, organizing outdoor activities, and facilitating daily hour-long meetings where we discussed activity ideas, workday schedules, and ways to improve the program.
